This repository shows how you can use the [Walter.Cypher NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Walter.Cypher/) in your code using little code snippets.

## Walter.Web.CypherTests sample code
This sample code shows the use of 
1. Fixed [cypher](https://github.com/ASP-WAF/Cypher/blob/master/Src/SamplesUsingMsTest/CryptoTests.cs) using a password to protect your code.
2. Generating [checksum](https://github.com/ASP-WAF/Cypher/blob/master/Src/SamplesUsingMsTest/ChecksumTest.cs) for tamper detection.
3. [PGP](https://github.com/ASP-WAF/Cypher/blob/master/Src/SamplesUsingMsTest/PGPManagedTests.cs) using various key strengths to protect data
4. The use of [Numeric encryption](https://github.com/ASP-WAF/Cypher/blob/master/Src/SamplesUsingMsTest/StringExtensionsTests.cs) that can be used to defeat base64 scanning tools to detect cyphered constants for password probing as values can be stored in int64 type values
